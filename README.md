## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The core programming language for this application.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Handles loading and displaying dice images dynamically.
- **Random Library**: Simulates the dice rolls by generating random numbers.

### üé≤ Dice Images

Ensure the `images` directory contains six images named:
- `dice1.png`  
- `dice2.png`  
- `dice3.png`  
- `dice4.png`  
- `dice5.png`  
- `dice6.png`  

Each image should visually represent one side of a six-sided dice.
